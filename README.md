# Hackathon Project: Computer Vision for AgriTech

## Overview

This project leverages cutting-edge computer vision models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and MobileNet, to build an intelligent image detection system tailored for the AgriTech sector. The goal is to explore practical applications of deep learning in agriculture, such as crop health monitoring, pest detection, and livestock tracking. By utilizing existing datasets, data loaders, and pre-trained models, this project aims to create an efficient and scalable solution.

## Why AgriTech?

Agriculture faces challenges such as pest infestations, crop diseases, and inefficient resource management. Computer vision can assist farmers in:

- **Detecting plant diseases early** to prevent large-scale damage.
- **Identifying pest infestations** before they spread.
- **Monitoring livestock** to ensure their well-being.
- **Optimizing irrigation and resource allocation** using aerial imagery.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** – A real-time object detection model.
- **MobileNet** – A lightweight deep-learning model optimized for mobile devices.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow** – Deep learning frameworks for model training and evaluation.
- **OpenCV** – Image processing library.
- **Pre-trained models and datasets** – Leveraging existing resources to speed up development.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

- Use open-source agricultural image datasets (e.g., PlantVillage for disease detection).
- Collect images using UAVs (drones) for aerial monitoring.
- Apply preprocessing techniques (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

### 2. Model Selection & Training

- Choose between YOLO and MobileNet based on application needs.
- Load pre-trained weights to enhance performance.
- Train on a custom dataset for agricultural object detection.

### 3. Model Evaluation & Optimization

- Test the trained model on unseen data.
- Use performance metrics (mAP, F1-score, IoU) to assess accuracy.
- Optimize model performance using techniques like pruning and quantization.

### 4. Deployment & Integration

- Deploy the model on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano) for real-time inference.
- Integrate with UAVs for autonomous monitoring.
- Build a simple web or mobile app for farmers to access insights.
